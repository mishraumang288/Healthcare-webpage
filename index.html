            <p>Devices in the form of wearables like fitness bands and other wirelessly connected devices like blood pressure and heart rate monitoring cuffs, glucometer etc. give patients access to personalized attention. These devices can be tuned to remind calorie count, exercise check, appointments, blood pressure variations and much more.IoT has changed people’s lives, especially elderly patients, by enabling constant tracking of health conditions. This has a major impact on people living alone and their families.<p>

            <h1>IoT for Physicians</h1>
            
            <p> By using wearables and other home monitoring equipment embedded with IoT, physicians can keep track of patients’ health more effectively. They can track patients’ adherence to treatment plans or any need for immediate medical attention. IoT enables healthcare professionals to be more watchful and connect with the patients proactively. Data collected from IoT devices can help physicians identify the best treatment process for patients and reach the expected outcomes.</p>

            <p>Apart from monitoring patients’ health, there are many other areas where IoT devices are very useful in hospitals. IoT devices tagged with sensors are used for tracking real time location of medical equipment like wheelchairs, defibrillators, nebulizers, oxygen pumps and other monitoring equipment. Deployment of medical staff at different locations can also be analyzed real time.The spread of infections is a major concern for patients in hospitals. IoT-enabled hygiene monitoring devices help in preventing patients from getting infected. </p>

            <h1>IoT for Health-Insurance Companies</h1>
            
            <p>There are numerous opportunities for health insurers with IoT-connected intelligent devices. Insurance companies can leverage data captured through health monitoring devices for their underwriting and claims operations. This data will enable them to detect fraud claims and identify prospects for underwriting. IoT devices bring transparency between insurers and customers in the underwriting, pricing, claims handling, and risk assessment processes. In the light of IoT-captured data-driven decisions in all operation processes, customers will have adequate visibility into underlying thought behind every decision made and process outcomes.</p>

            <p>Cities are dynamic living systems, residing more than half of the world population. Millions of residents enjoy their lives, making transportation choices, waiting in traffic, and riding bikes through the park. Introduction of weather to this already complex mis of individual and collective activities creates more complex air quality patterns that change every day.To understand the air quality patterns throughout the cities and how they affect the urban population, we need real-time information on every scale. </p>
